        <p class="title">Albay Tourist Spot's</p>
        <p class="description">The province of Albay is known for being home to the iconic Mount Mayon or Mayon Volcano. However, it is worth noting that while it is one of the top tourist spots in Bicol Albay and one of the top Luzon tourist spots, an unobstructed view of its perfect cone is not guaranteed as this is dependent on the weather.

            Itâ€™s a good thing there are plenty of other Albay tourist spots you can see when visiting the province, ensuring you get to enjoy your trip. 
            
            Located in the Bicol Region, Albay is roughly 450 kilometers away from Metro Manila, and its capital, Legazpi City is accessible via land trips or direct flights from Manila or Cebu.
